### Instructions
Follow the steps given below.

#### Step 1
 
 Study the following algorithms.       
 
1.  K-nearest neighbour classification
1.  Linear discriminant analysis 
1.  Na√Øve Bayes classifier 
1.  Support vector machine 
1.  Logistic regression
1.  Random forests
1.  Ada boost
1.  Gradient boost
1.  XGBoost 
 
At the end of the excercise, you should be able to answer the following questions.
1. What are the important parameters in each algorithm? 
1. How and why those parameters affect the results of respective algorithms?

#### Step 2

Follow the steps given below to write your code.
1. In your code, download a dataset  using Python `openml` package
1. Prepare data
    1. Identify the data types: boolean/categorical, ordinal, numeric in this case. But there can be many other types as well.
    1. Transform categorical variable to numeric as necessary     
    1. Min-max normalise
1. Use [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) to walk through the parameter grid.    
    1. Use `f1_score` to assess the performance
    2. Use random states 1 to 10
    3. Use 5 fold cross validation in parameter search    
    4. Record execution time
1. Save the results to CSV files.  

#### Step 3

1. Execute your code over all the algorithms and all the datasets.
1. Save your results to CSV files.

#### Step 4

1. Create Tableau Dashboards or Plotly visualisations to analyse your results.
1. With visualisations:
    1. for each dataset compare and contrast results produced by each algorithm under optimal parameter settings
    1. for each given algorithm, how `f1_score` varies with the different parameter values
    1. Discuss the execution times of algorithms and their parameter settings? 
1. What are the most important parameters in each algorithm
1. Create a presentation or a pdf document or a Jupyter Notebook explaining `Support vector machine`.    

## Quality Standard of Your Work
1. Code should follow PEP8 Standard
1. Host your code on your GitHub in a public or private repository as you prefer. 
- If it is a public repository, send the link for us to evaluate.
- If it is a private repository, share (view only) with our GitHub usernames. Please contact us for them.
