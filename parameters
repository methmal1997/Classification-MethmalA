K-nearest neighbour classification-n_neighbors (how much distance measure from the center)
                                    metric(measurement metric)
                                    
Linear discriminant analysis- solver

                              ‘svd’: Singular value decomposition (default). Does not compute the covariance matrix, therefore this solver is                               recommended for data with a large number of features.

                             ‘lsqr’: Least squares solution. Can be combined with shrinkage or custom covariance estimator.

                              ‘eigen’: Eigenvalue decomposition. Can be combined with shrinkage or custom covariance estimator.     


Naïve Bayes classifier-var_smoothing (Portion of the largest variance of all features that is added to variances for calculation stability)


Support vector machine - kernel,gamma


Logistic regression - penalty


Random forests  -  n_estimators -number of trees in the forest

                   criterion - measure the quality of split
                   
                   
Ada boost - n_estimators (The maximum number of estimators at which boosting is terminated)

            algorithm
            
Gradient boost - max_depth(The maximum depth of the individual)
                n_estimators (The number of boosting stages to perform)
                earning_rate (Learning rate shrinks the contribution of each tree by learning_rate)
